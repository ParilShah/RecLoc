-- The basic idea of this project is to develop a simple and efficient application which help the users to explore new places, attractions and destinations using posted images by the user in the past. The application constantly focuses on user directed search from the pool of images. Photos of these destinations or places guides new users to having better understanding through various perceptive. On the other side the active users who are actually visiting those places can upload their collection which can be used by some other user as reference in future.

Currently, this application will be developed in iOS front end user interface it will manage a cloud database on which all user can upload their collection and similarly the same collection can be used as reference for users who are exploring new places. This iOS interface will provide various discrete categorical destination options like beach and forest etc. Along with country selection as primary search request criteria. This selected labels will initiate a search request in cloud database and return the relevant results. User can then be directed to the location of the selected place Maps can be used to direct the user to the location of the selected place
