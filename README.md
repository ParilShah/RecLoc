# RecLoc
CSC 258 Distributed System project, Swift | REST(Spring) | AWS 

This is a term project for Distribution System course. 

The application suggests locations to a new user on basis of filter (Forest, bitch etc.). We are using AWS Rekognistion SDK for retriving objects from the images uploaded by other users.
On basis of those tags, when a user search about particular location, then a user will get info for the location.
